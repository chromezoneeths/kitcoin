# How to contribute

When contributing to Kitcoin, please follow these guidelines:

* Use [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) as your linter.
* Run `xo --fix` before pushing.
* Before pushing a feature, please write a test for it.
* Push development changes to `edge`.
* Only merge to master when all tests pass.
* DO NOT squash commits when merging - this erases authorship and is rude to your fellow developers.
